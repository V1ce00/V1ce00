[this is ALREADY on my STRAWPAGE ( https://vicesz.straw.page ) but I just figured out this whole coding thing, so I'm doing it here.]

â€” âœ§. I am VERY socially awkward. Some jokes directed to you or other people are ALWAYS JOKES. I am not a person that uses tone tags as much as I should, In which I am trying to work on considering there is some people I've met who've taken me seriously.

My actions are NEVER and WILL NEVER be intended to hurt or distress people in any way, my awkwardness can be addressed, as I do appreciate the honesty.

â€” âœ§. I AM DIAGNOSED WITH SEVERE SEPERATION ANXIETY!!

This means that people I am ONLY close to (ex: Family, friends, partner) I will have mental episodes and might spam you ðŸ’” But, I was diagnosed with this when I was 5, so It is increasingly gotten better, and I don't think you should worry about it as much.

â€” âœ§. I am a HSP (Hypersensitive person). Meaning that arguments that involve a person raising their voice or getting overwhelmed with emotions. Crying seems like the only possible solution even though you can't control it. 

More information on HSP : [ https://www.tiktok.com/@mentohood/video/7488909951876844842?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7494830050401338911 ] 

So PLEASE for the love of Neptune. Be careful on what you say or do around me, or ANYONE. I rarely do cry with text arguments considering there is no 'raising voices' but I guess this would be directed to people who know me in person or anything of the sorts.
