[this is ALREADY on my STRAWPAGE ( https://vicesz.straw.page ) but I just figured out this whole coding thing, so I'm doing it here.]

â€” âœ§. I am VERY socially awkward. 
-
Some jokes directed to you or other people are ALWAYS JOKES. I am not a person that uses tone tags as much as I should, In which I am trying to work on considering there is some people I've met who've taken me seriously.

My actions are NEVER and WILL NEVER be intended to hurt or distress people in any way, my awkwardness can be addressed, as I do appreciate the honesty.

â€” âœ§. I AM DIAGNOSED WITH SEVERE SEPERATION ANXIETY!!
-
This means that people I am ONLY close to (ex: Family, friends, partner) I will have mental episodes and might spam you ðŸ’” But, I was diagnosed with this when I was 5, so It is increasingly gotten better, and I don't think you should worry about it as much.

â€” âœ§. I am a HSP (Hypersensitive person).
-
 Meaning that arguments that involve a person raising their voice or getting overwhelmed with emotions. Crying seems like the only possible solution even though you can't control it.


More information on HSP : [ https://www.tiktok.com/@mentohood/video/7488909951876844842?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7494830050401338911 ] 

So PLEASE for the love of Neptune. Be careful on what you say or do around me, or ANYONE. I rarely do cry with text arguments considering there is no 'raising voices' but I guess this would be directed to people who know me in person or anything of the sorts.


â€” âœ§. I AM CLINGY !!!!!
-
Am I the person that will text you when you're sleeping saying "I miss you" in the middle of the night ???!? 

HELL YEAH !!!1!1!!??

I love clingy people with my whole heart n soul, but when it comes down to me it just seems awkward and embarrassing. BECAUSE IDK HOW TO COMPREHEND FEELINGS ATP.

â€” âœ§. ONLINE DATING.
-
First, I will clarify that I don't CARE if you're "e-dating" or in a online relationship. As we are all human and you might have some reasons on to why you personally prefer it online.

If I get into a online relationship, there are going to be a lot of boundaries, like any type of trust worthy relationship would have. And I usually WONT be online dating someone unless I know them well enough and actually make the decision to have an association with that person.

As to sexuality, I don't PUT IT OUT THERE. But I am straight, have been straight, will be straight, and that's the end of it. I have been PEER PRESSURED on how many times that I might be "lesbian" or 
"Bisexual" but that will be on my DNI and INT page if you haven't checked it out already.

â€” âœ§. My regards to "Undiagnosed" symptoms.
-
I hate to say that I 'despise' people outwardly saying they either have ADHD or Autism because they want to fit the algorithim these days, in which is so sad if you think about it. I don't support those types of things.

BUT.

I will say that I have symptoms towards ADHD and POSSIBLY autism. My assumptions shouldn't be taken seriously as I might be completely wrong and I might not be diagnosed with anything for all I care. Just be careful if you want to self diagnose yourself without any further proof if ykwim ðŸ˜¸
